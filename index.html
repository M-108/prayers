      <p align="justify">
        Although Kṛṣṇa was not present before her, Kuntī offered her prayers to
        Him as if she were in His presence face to face. This is possible for
        anyone following in the footsteps of Kuntī. Kṛṣṇa does not have to be
        physically present everywhere. He is actually present everywhere by
        spiritual potency, and one simply has to surrender unto Him sincerely.
        When Kuntī was offering her prayers very feelingly to Kṛṣṇa, she could
        not check herself and began to cry loudly before Akrūra.
