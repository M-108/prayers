        Although Kṛṣṇa was not present before her, Kuntī offered her prayers to
        Him as if she were in His presence face to face. This is possible for
        anyone following in the footsteps of Kuntī. Kṛṣṇa does not have to be
        physically present everywhere. He is actually present everywhere by
        spiritual potency, and one simply has to surrender unto Him sincerely.
        When Kuntī was offering her prayers very feelingly to Kṛṣṇa, she could
        not check herself and began to cry loudly before Akrūra.

          <h1>John Wick 3</h1>
          <p>
            After gunning down a member of the High Table -- the shadowy
            international assassin's guild -- legendary hit man John Wick finds
            himself stripped of the organization's protective services. Now
            stuck with a $14 million bounty on his head, Wick must fight his way
            through the streets of New York as he becomes the target of the
            world's most ruthless killers.

            If you have a problem and there is nowhere else to turn, the
            mysterious and elusive Robert McCall will deliver the vigilante
            justice you seek. This time, however, McCall's past cuts especially
            close to home when thugs kill Susan Plummer -- his best friend and
            former colleague. Now out for revenge, McCall must take on a crew of
            highly trained assassins who'll stop at nothing to destroy him.
